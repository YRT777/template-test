<p></p><p>Promotion of innovation and technology is everywhere nowadays as internet services are becoming more popular and facilities are getting more advanced. Individuals, companies and all aspects of our society are enjoying the benefits brought by this new global norm. Yet, people have to face the challenges such as risks and threats that come with the advantages, as the number and categories of cyberattacks and cybercrimes keeps on surging. To combat against these issues, the HKSAR government is considering to enact a new law in this respect, as our Chief Executive has announced earlier in her Policy Address. The aforementioned legislation, once executed, can raise the standard of cybersecurity in Hong Kong and offer better holistic protection to Hong Kong and its citizens in this respect. Cybersecurity has come of age! As a forward-looking vocational and professional education and training (VPET) provider, HKCT launches a new Higher Diploma in Cybersecurity to meet the demand for talents in this profession.
